# Jekyll Résumé
A lightweight, Jekyll-powered and Github Pages friendly resume. Responsive naturally.

Powered by Jekyll, and Github Pages ready, Jekyll-résumé is a lightweight and
lightning-fast html résumé-making-machine from @nternetinspired.

## Why?
Because real web developers don't showcase their skills on bits of dead tree. Why
Write about writing html when you can write html??

## Want?
Turning this into your own résumé is pretty straightforward I think.

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/nternetinspired/jekyll-resume/fork)
2. Edit <a href="_config.yml">_config.yml</a> so it contains your personal info; name, email, phone number, etc.
3. Edit <a href="index.html">index.html</a> so it contains your shit, not [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/).
4. Tweak [my Sass](_sass) if required.

That's it, Github should build your site automatically to: http://[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME].github.io/jekyll-resume just as mine builds automatically to [http://nternetinspired.github.io/jekyll-resume](http://nternetinspired.github.io/jekyll-resume)
